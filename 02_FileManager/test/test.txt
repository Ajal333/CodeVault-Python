Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. 
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design 
philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant 
whitespace.

Python was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, 
released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage 
collection system with reference counting.

Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not 
completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on 
Python 3.
