# :open_file_folder: Command Line File Manager :page_facing_up: - Python :snake:

This is a terminal app built using Python(3.9) which can handle File Manager Operations. With this Python based File Manager you can navigate through directories, and can <br />

* :open_file_folder: Create Directories
* :page_facing_up: Create Files
* :open_file_folder: Move Directories
* :page_facing_up: Move Files
* :open_file_folder: Rename Directories
* :page_facing_up: Rename Files
* :open_file_folder: Delete Directories 
* :page_facing_up: Delete Files

<br />

It's not a text editor. So you cannot edit the contents in a file. :sweat_smile:
